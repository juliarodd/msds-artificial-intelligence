## About

This repo contains Julia Rodd's assignments from Northwestern University's MSDS Artificial Intelligence class. 

This class featured four assignments. Below is a brief summary of each assignment:

* Assignment 1 - Leverages the Scikit Learn digits data set to understand how basic neural networks (MLP) work.
* Assignment 2 - Explores various CNN model architectures using black and white images of dogs and cats.
* Assignment 3 - Explores various RNN model architectures using a reduced reuters corpus with one topic per document.
* Assignment 4 - ompares/contrasts various model architectures using longitudinal data from a call center.

## Getting started

All assignments leverage the package keras with tensorflow backend.

Another uncommon package that might need to be installed is PrettyTable to render the tables used in these assignments.

## Limitations

There are some limitations in storing the data that is used in some assignments.

* Data for assignment 2 is not provided.
* Data for assignment 4 has to be downloaded first from Kaggle.

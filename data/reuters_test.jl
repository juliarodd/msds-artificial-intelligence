Others argue the merger\n  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\n  network from scratch.\n      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\n  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\n  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\n  wisdom of some of those moves.\n      \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\n  it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\n  financial analyst Simon Smithson.\n      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\n  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\n  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\n  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\n  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\n  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\n  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\n  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\n  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\n  into the securities business at home.\n      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\n  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\n  from investment banking.\n      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\n  said he hopes further deregulation will create new\n  opportunities.\n      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\n  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\n  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n      \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\n  in two or three years,\" he said.\n      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\n  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\n  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\n  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\n  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n      \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\n  Kleinwort's Smithson.\n      \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\n  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the\n  strategy is right or wrong.\"\n  \n\n"}

His petition said UCPB's\n  plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of\n  fiduciary duties.\"\n      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\n  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\n  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\n  government nominee on the company's board.\n      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,\n  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\n  the company's board.\n      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\n  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\n  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained\n  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\n  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\n  dividends.\n      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\n  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\n  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon\n  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\n  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\n  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\n  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\n  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong\n  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\n  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board\n  meeting.\n      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\n  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\n  April 15.\n      \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\n  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\n  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\n  disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in\n  a statement.\n      \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\n  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\n  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\n  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\n  of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.\n      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\n  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from\n  us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"\n      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\n  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\n  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\n  States citizen.\n      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,\n  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which\n  are available to foreign buyers.\n      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\n  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\n  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\n  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\n  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on\n  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\n  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\n  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\n  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\n  announced last June.\n      \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz\n  told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"\n      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\n  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'\n  meeting, scheduled for May 14.\n      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\n  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n  1985.

If Brazil does not resume\n  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\n      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for\n  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\n  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\n      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\n  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\n  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\n      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were\n  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\n  earlier.

Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\n  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\"\n      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\n      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\n  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\n  Burlington actually came into play.\n      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\n  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\n  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\n  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\n  a U.S. acquisition.\n      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer\n  has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but\n  would not say whether Burlington was among them.\n      \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not\n  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\n  housecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\n  McKinnon.\n      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\n  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs\n  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its\n  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\n  competition, Gormley said.\n      \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"\n  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\n  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\n  and other fabric to the auto industry.\n      \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\n  on the outlays they did make,\" she said.\n      \"You look at their record over the year, and I think\n  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\n  past,\" Gormley said.\n       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\n  from 2.01 dlrs per share.\n      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\n  at its current levels.\n      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\n  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\n  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\n  basis.\n      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\n  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\n      \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\n  don't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager.\n      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\n  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\n  he doesn't win the target company.\n      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\n  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying\n  Ponderosa Inc.\n      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with\n  Burlington.\n      J.P.

The\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\n  regionalized.\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n  1986 sales.\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\n  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\n  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\n  money.\n  \n\n"}

But Volcker\n  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\n  with danger.\n      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\n  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\n  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\n  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\n  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\n  should be stabilized at around current levels.\n      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\n  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\n  agreed to cut its budget deficit.\n      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\n  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\n  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n      \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\n  you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\n  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\n  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\n  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\n  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\n  States.\n      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\n  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\n  that any deficit reduction was better than none.\n      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \n  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\n  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\n  from plunging further in world exchange markets.\n      \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\n  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\n  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\n  is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\n  most vexing and persistent problems.\n      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\n  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\n  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by\n  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\n      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\n  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\n  federal budget.\n      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\n  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\n  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\n  budget law.\n      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\n  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\n  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\n  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n      \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\n  most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\n  said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that\n  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\n  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n      \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\n  reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\n  look like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\n  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\n  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\n  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\n  anticipated spending levels for next year.\n      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\n  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \n  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n  \n\n"}

The important thing is that it\n  continue year after year,\" Lawson said.\n      The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\n  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\n  weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\n  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\n      Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\n  the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been\n  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"\n      Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\n  said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n  ... but one has to be vigilant.\"\n      He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n  \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n  \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the\n  same thing,\" he said.\n      Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\n  measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\n  weakness for that agreement.\n      Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's\n  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\n  domestic demand.\n      They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\n  increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\n  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\n  the second half of this year.\n  \n\n"}

Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for\n  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and\n  securities for the balance.\n      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.\n      \"I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in\n  with another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at\n  51 or 52 dlrs per share.\n      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of\n  Borg-Warner's stock.\n      \"You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up\n  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have\n  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking\n  at it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard\n  Henderson said.\n      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.\n      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill\n  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.\n      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\n  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\n  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as\n  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.\n      \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical\n  operation these days,\" said Henderson.\n      \"He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he\n  does not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson.\n      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover\n  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF\n  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its\n  investment in Carbide.\n      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its\n  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer\n  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would\n  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.\n      \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst.\n      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be\n  forthcoming shortly.\n      \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this\n  book,\" he said.\n      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,\n  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security\n  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.\n      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows\n  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it\n  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per\n  share.\n      \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said\n  Rose.\n      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman\n  would do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\"\n      \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical\n  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose\n  said.\n      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add\n  earnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as\n  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if\n  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John\n  Henry of E.F. Hutton.\n      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986\n  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion\n  dlrs.

Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.\n  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\n  to cover transactions, it said.\n      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\n  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\n  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over\n  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\n      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\n  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\n      \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\n  could,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\n  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\n  supplies.\n      \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\n  avalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we\n  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\"\n      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\n  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\n  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\n  said.\n      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\n  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\n  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\n  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.\n      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last\n  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today\n  said, \"a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on\n  supplying. They had cancelled last week.\"\n      He declined to identify the company.\n      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil\n  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also\n  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.\n      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the\n  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key\n  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the\n  Algerians, he added.\n      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter\n  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines\n  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.\n      \"It will be business as usual for Texaco,\" said Martin\n  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer\n  and Traub.\n      \"Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,\" he said. \"But\n  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and\n  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.\"\n      But other officials at Texaco were not immediately\n  available to say whether discussions were being held with its\n  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.\n  \n\n"}

It rose as high\n  as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome\n  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.\n      TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\n  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\n  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\n  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\n      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\n  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\n  stressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial\n  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.\"\n      \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\n  &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian\n  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert\n  of Peters and Co Ltd.\n      David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\n  Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\n  BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\n  of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.\n      Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\n  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks\n  with Dome.\n      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\n  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\n      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully\n  optimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\n  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\n  dlrs Canadian per common share.\n      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\n  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\n  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\n  would own 80 pct.\n      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\n  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The\n  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"\n  he said.\n      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the\n  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\"\n      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\n  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\n  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\n  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\n  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\n      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\n  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\n  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company\n  wanted to expand.\n      \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\n  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\n  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"\n  Gobert said.\n      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\n  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\n  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\n  cubic feet of natural gas.\n      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\n  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\n  heart of Canada's oil industry.\n     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\n  land across Canada.\n     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\n  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of\n  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the\n  largest ever by a Canadian company.\n  \n\n"}

The money could be spent on\n  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting\n  domestic growth, it added.\n      \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo\n  said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"\n      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector\n  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent\n  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37\n  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.\n      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm\n  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential\n  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,\n  economists said.\n      \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the\n  expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor\n  at Kyoto Gakuen University.\n      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform\n  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic\n  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the\n  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really\n  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to\n  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei\n  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'\n  Associations told a recent press conference.\n      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek\n  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade\n  deficits with Japan.\n      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well\n  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.\n      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there\n  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban\n  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on\n  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several\n  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.\n      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform\n  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,\n  the analysts said.\n      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the\n  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for\n  national food security, they said.\n      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to\n  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms\n  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.\n      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific\n  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.\n  \n\n"}

The\n  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other\n  sources so there would be little effect on the American\n  consumer, Fitzwater said.\n      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\n  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\n  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\n      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\n      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\n  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\n  one-third of America's overall deficit.\n      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\n  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\n  president is ready to fight them all.\n      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret\n  that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and\n  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\n  American competitiveness in world markets.\n      \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\n  practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California\n  vacation home at Santa Barbara.\n      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\n  abided by the agreement.\n      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\n  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\n  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\n      The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't\n  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\n  practice.\"\n      The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an\n  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\n  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\n  overall of our trade laws.\"\n      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\n  in the best interests of the United States, and that\n  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\n      \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he\n  said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\n  trade.\"\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n      But other analysts said it made little difference whether\n  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\n  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on\n  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n      Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\n  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\n  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n      But other analysts said it made little difference whether\n  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\n  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on\n  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n      Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\n  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\n  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n  \n\n"}

Discount\n  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\n  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\n  with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\n  Corp.\n      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\n  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\n      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\n  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\n  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\n  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\n      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\n  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\n  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\n  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\n  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.\n      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\n  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\n  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\n  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\n      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\n  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\n  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\n  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\n  pay annual income taxes.\n      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\n  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\n      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\n  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\n  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\n  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\n  add reserves too late.\n      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\n  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\n  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\n  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\n  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\n  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\n      \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\n  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"\n  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\n      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\n  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\n  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\n      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\n  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\n  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \n  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the\n  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\n      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\n  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\n  figures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\n  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"\n      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\n  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\n  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\n      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\n  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\n  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\n  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.\n  \n\n"}

The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of\n  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a\n  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct\n  convertible debentures.\n      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by\n  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for\n  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent\n  conveyance.\n      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose\n  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it\n  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to\n  repay it.\n      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to\n  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an\n  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed\n  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.\n      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,\n  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the\n  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its\n  alternatives.\n      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation\n  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt\n  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on\n  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.\n      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous\n  increase effective on the June eight record date for the\n  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon\n  conversion of the debentures.

Hutton analyst\n  Terence Quinn.\n      That field is a segment of the market known as system\n  utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of\n  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,\n  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.\n      The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the\n  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.\n  Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that\n  will find the competition much harder than in the past.\n      For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a\n  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,\n  N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.\n      When the deal is completed sometime in August, the\n  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past \n  Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent\n  software vendor.\n      Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang\n  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\n  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\n  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\n  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\n  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\n  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\n  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\n  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\n  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\n  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n  56 cts a share.\n     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\n  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer\n  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\n  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\n  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services\n  unit.\n      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\n  news conference that the merger would give computer users a\n  single source for a wide range of software products.\n      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\n  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\n  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has\n  been successful with accounting and banking systems.\n      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\n  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\n  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\n  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\n  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\n  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\n  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\n  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\n  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\n  dlrs a share.\n      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\n  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\n  and research and development.\n      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\n  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\n  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\n  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times\n  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\n  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n  \n      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\n  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\n  owns 58 pct of Uccel.\n      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\n  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\n  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\n  Department.\n      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\n  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n  \n\n"}

Arbitrageurs said there was\n  disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.\n      \"We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22\n  dlrs,\" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for\n  17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct\n  cumulative preferred stock.\n  \n      Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said \"you\n  have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.\"\n      Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the\n  company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.\n  \"They have not done the right things at the right time,\" he\n  said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined\n  since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the\n  fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,\n  he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln\n  dlrs.\n      Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people\n  than many competitors, but it competes on price even though\n  competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.\n  He noted that there have been no other publicly identified\n  bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier\n  Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.\n      Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for\n  another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone\n  in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a\n  deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and\n  Bilzerian's plan.\n  \n\n"}

A preliminary\n  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until\n  the case is decided.\n      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr\n  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share\n  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens\n  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens\n  offer.\n      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and\n  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about\n  the company in making their takeover attempt.\n   \n      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James\n  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber\n  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23\n  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's\n  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,\n  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to\n  divulge inside information about the company.\n      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began\n  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\n  \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its\n  management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.\n      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from\n  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information\n  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or\n  Burlington's public financial statements.\n      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with\n  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with\n  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went\n  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.\n  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a\n  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in\n  February.\n      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held\n  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as\n  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off\n  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and\n  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide\n  inside information.\n      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen\n  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman\n  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and\n  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an\n  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.\n      \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the\n  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for\n  those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington\n  lawyer Humphrey.\n      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the\n  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in\n  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's\n  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants\n  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,\n  the lawyers said.\n      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the\n  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends\n  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light\n  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price\n  dictate.\n      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by\n  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid\n  for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose\n  would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,\n  a Samjens lawyer.\n  \n\n"}

But officials noted that Poehl has worked\n  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\n  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\n  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\n  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\n  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\n  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\n  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\n  of galloping inflation this century.\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\n  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n      \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\n  economy,\" she said.\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\n  currencies.\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\n  don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\n  round, making a speculator's position worthless.\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\n  play golf.\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\n  are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\n  many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\n  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.\n  \n\n"}

He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\n      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction\n  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"\n      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\n  \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy\n  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\n  he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate.\n      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\n  currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing\n  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\n  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"\n      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\n  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\n  commitments underlying the accord.\n      \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\n  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\n  commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.\n  Budget deficit was \"very important.\"\n      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\n  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\n  said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\n  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"\n      \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\n  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\n  wholly unjustified,\" he said.\n      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan\n  bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\n  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\n  Japanese development aid over the next three years.\n      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\n  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\n      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\n  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\n  jack up faltering economic growth.\n      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\n  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\n  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with\n  the privatisation of German national industries.\n      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan\n  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to\n  make progress in Venice.\n      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign\n  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World\n  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.\n      Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing\n  for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would\n  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\n      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase\n  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt\n  provisions.\n      \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market\n  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this\n  sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.\n      U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,\n  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.\n  \"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\"\n  Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to\n  determine the appropriate size of provisions.\n      He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be\n  discussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to\n  push further.\"\n  \n\n"}

This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six\n  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the\n  same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.\n      CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.\n  \n      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond\n  describing it as a long term investment.\n      ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is\n  a leader in building materials, Herbert said.\n      \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.\n      CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its\n  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves\n  into energy several years ago.\n      Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert\n  said: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to\n  wonder if Monier is the main target.\"\n  \n      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a\n  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.\n      Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its\n  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.\n      The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on\n  yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign\n  shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review\n  Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.\n      Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely\n  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge\n  the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.\n  \n      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible\n  acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a\n  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the\n  negotiations foundered on the price.\n      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not\n  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid\n  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.\n      \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of\n  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having\n  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.\n      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.\n  \n\n"}

{"corpus": "reuters", "dataset": "test", "filename": "test/18621", "category": "crude", "text": "OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS\n  Some OPEC states are unhappy about the\n  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\n  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\n  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\n      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\n  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\n  about price differentials making some of their crudes\n  uncompetitive.\n      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\n  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\n  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\n      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\n  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\n  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\n      \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\n  differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But\n  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well\n  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"\n      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\n  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\n  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\n  marketing incentives have helped their sales.\n      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\n  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\n  better priced grades in a \"package.\"\n      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\n  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\n  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\n  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\n  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\n  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\n  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\n  when members offered discounts to attract customers.\n      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\n  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\n  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\n  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\n  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\n  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\n  analysts say.\n      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\n  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\n  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\n  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\n  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\n  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\n  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing\n  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\n  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\n  pay the new prices.\n     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\n  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\n  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\n  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\n  risen.\n      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\n  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\n  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\n  differentials question in Vienna.\n      \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\n  holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n  \n\n"}

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\n  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n      \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\n  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\n  to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\n  Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\n  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\n  takeover target.\n      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\n  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\n  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\n  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\n  three yesterday.\n      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\n  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\n  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\n  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\n  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\n  returned telephone calls seeking comment.\n      \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\n  someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\n  Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\n  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\n  dlrs per share.\"\n      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\n  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\n  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\n  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\n  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\n  operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\n  the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\n  has recently made two other acquisitions.\n      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\n  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\n  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\n  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,\n  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston\n  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.\n      \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\n  Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\n  company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\n  to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\n  consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\n  said.\n     \n      Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n  \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\n  calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to\n  be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\n  shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\n  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\n  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\n  agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank\n  N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial\n  adviser.\n  \n\n"}

Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but\n  neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.\n      Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic\n  products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.\n      Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement \n  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop\n  new biotechnology products in several fields.\n     \n      As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'\n  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.\n  Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but\n  not in North American and Western Europe.\n      \"We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood\n  that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in\n  North America and Europe,\" said Fildes.\n      He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a\n  major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its\n  own in that market.\n     \n      Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with\n  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own\n  business. Many large corporations have invested in small\n  biotech firms.\n      But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made\n  in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus\n  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship\n  with a large number of other biotechnology companies.\"\n     \n      Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug\n  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to \"keep the\n  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.\"\n      Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to\n  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas\n  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory\n  markets.\n      Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research\n  over the next five years.\n     \n      \"Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and\n  development to make it happen, while the equity position part\n  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this\n  partnership,\" said Fildes.\n  \n\n"}

U.S. Lenders,\n  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\n  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\n  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\n  induce them to retain their accounts.\n      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\n  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\n  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n      \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\n  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\n  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\n  offering variable rate mortgages.\n      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\n  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\n  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still\n  more.\n      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\n  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\n  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\n  new business, officials at all three institutions said.\n      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\n  below those on the variable rate loans.\n      \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\n  rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\n  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\n  new mortgage loans.\n      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\n  loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\n  mortgage product.\"\n      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\n  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\n  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n      \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\n  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\n  of its 1986 volume.\n      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\n  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\n  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\n  lender is earning an above average return on assets.\n      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\n  the benefit of cheap money.\n      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\n  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\n  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\n  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n      Young explained that the company had planned to protect\n  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\n  complicated hedging instrument.\n      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\n  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\n  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the\n  mortgages and hedge profitably.\n      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\n  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\n  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\n  and selling them to an investor.\n      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\n  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\n  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\n  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\n  over the past few years.\n  \n\n"}

{"corpus": "reuters", "dataset": "test", "filename": "test/19285", "category": "crude", "text": "U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING\n  U.S. crude oil prices are at their\n  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC\n  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any\n  policy changes from the session.\n      They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the\n  organization's accord in December, have risen on technical\n  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because\n  of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the\n  Gulf.\n      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading\n  around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile\n  Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its\n  highest level since January 1986.\n      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\n  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\n  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\n  agreement may only need a slight review.\n      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\n  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\n  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\n      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\n  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\n  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\n  should begin easing.\n      \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\n  to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\n  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\n  barrels in the fourth quarter.\n      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\n  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\n  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\n  reduction in output.\n      \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\n  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\n  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\n  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\n  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n      \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\n  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\n  committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\n  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\n  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\n  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\n  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\n  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\n  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\n  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\n  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\n  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\n  producers receive less money for their oil.\n      \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\n  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n      \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\n  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\n  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\n  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\n  said.\n      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n      \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\n  Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\n  Securites.\n      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\n  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\n  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\n  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n      \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\n  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\n  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.\n  \n\n"}

The price gyrations have\n  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\n  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\n  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\n  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\n  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\n  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\n  for an international securities marketplace in which trading\n  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\n  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\n  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\n  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\n  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\n  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\n  review of hostile corporate takeovers.\n      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\n  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\n  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n      In line with the views of other top administration\n  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\n  battles over new federal regulations.\n      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\n  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\n  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\n  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\n  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\n  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\n  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\n  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\n  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n      The agency is one of the few in the government that\n  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\n  few years because of fees it charges public companies,\n  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\n  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\n  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\n  for policy differences alone.\n      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\n  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\n  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\n  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\n  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\n  market manipulations by large investment firms.\n      The agency requires public companies and investment\n  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\n  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their\n  condition any time they issue new securities.\n      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\n  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\n  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\n  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\n  become the nation's 35th president.\n      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\n  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\n  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central\n  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n  \n\n"}

Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest\n  rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said.\n      This had to be taken into account when considering recent\n  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to\n  rising international money market rates that had spilled over\n  into the German market, he said.\n      Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far\n  ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.\n      \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is\n  definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so\n  noticeable in absolute figures.\n      The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also\n  attracted little attention, he said.\n  \n\n"}

And while many manufacturing firms turned\n  to financial market investments for profits during last year's\n  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to\n  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.\n      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is\n  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have\n  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase\n  inventories and step up capital spending, one government\n  economist said.\n      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price\n  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices\n  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a\n  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,\n  one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a\n  couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.\n  \n\n"}

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the\n  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\"\n      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which\n  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the\n  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation\n  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.\n      \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street\n  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said\n  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from\n  other London and Tokyo analysts.\n      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of\n  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary\n  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.\n      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the\n  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.\n      \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of\n  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their\n  interest rates,\" he added.\n      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime\n  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed\n  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial\n  system.\n      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock\n  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking\n  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.\n      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of\n  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said\n  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and\n  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in\n  mind.\n      \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.\n  If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic\n  growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a\n  more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's\n  Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in\n  danger.\n      \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is\n  disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted.\n      David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world\n  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven\n  (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,\n  as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies\n  is still on.\n      Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by\n  expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money\n  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency\n  stability.\n      But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said\n  Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived.

Sterling held its buoyant tone\n  throughout.\n      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,\n  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning\n  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.\n      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks\n  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a\n  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"With\n  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last\n  thing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said.\n      \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as\n  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\"\n  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu\n  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money\n  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct\n  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.\n      But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed\n  down is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.\n  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a\n  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money\n  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.\n      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank\n  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates\n  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by\n  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.\n      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in\n  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.\n      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in\n  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.\n      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity\n  markets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be a\n  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail\n  sales,\" Temperton said.\n      \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in\n  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added.\n      \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending\n  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very\n  serious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said.\n      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look\n  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,\n  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly\n  than bank lending.\n      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending\n  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy\n  personal sector borrowing.\n      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed\n  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66\n  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much\n  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.\n  \n\n"}

Secretary General\n  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a\n  Security Council call for a ceasefire.\n      \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any\n  chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear\n  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.\n  \n     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon\n  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington\n  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's\n  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had\n  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the\n  lower Gulf.\n      \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown\n  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting\n  capabilities,\" Cordesman said.\n      He predicted the United States would respond to any future\n  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar\n  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the\n  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.\n      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the\n  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but\n  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action\n  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\" \n  \n\n"}

For the remaining 52.6\n  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one\n  Irving share.\n      At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to\n  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per\n  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.\n      According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender\n  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.\n      Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would\n  affect the acquisition.\n      \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve\n  it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\"\n  said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.\n      \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\"\n  Alpert said.\n      \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at\n  present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a\n  share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst\n  said.\n      The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford\n  to retain its original offer.\n      However, industry sources were more uncertain about\n  prospects for the deal.\n      \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will\n  look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a\n  consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.\n      The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is\n  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases\n  the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.\n      Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely\n  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking\n  industry.\n      \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use\n  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price\n  is too depressed,\" Alpert said.\n      Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other\n  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.\n      \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered\n  more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.\n  \n\n"}

The\n  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet\n  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.\n      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove\n  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and\n  many services.\n      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli\n  pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to\n  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had\n  better get serious about improving the GATT.\"\n      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing\n  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially\n  increase the gross national products in both countries.\n      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should\n  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.\n      Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to\n  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\"\n      He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only\n  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries\n  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards\n  of living.\"\n      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress\n  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to\n  protectionism.\n      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress\n  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions\n  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United\n  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.\n      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade\n  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still\n  rising.\n      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to\n  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President\n  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.\n      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.\n      He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains\n  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"\n  \n\n"}

Reuter and\n  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September\n  production at 18.5 mln bpd.\n      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of\n  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea\n  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,\n  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag\n  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.\n      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the\n  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.\n      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on\n  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.\n  Attack, analysts said.\n      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which\n  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in\n  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.\n      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in\n  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf\n  hostilities, analysts said.\n      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian\n  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.\n      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,\n  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.\n      \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond\n  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any\n  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.\n  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said.\n      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a\n  responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to\n  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran\n  chose to raise the level of conflict.\n      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.\n      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as\n  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests\n  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a\n  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian\n  retaliation.\n      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a\n  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which\n  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile\n  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.\n      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy\n  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary\n  Caspar Weinburger.\n      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the\n  Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less\n  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,\n  analysts and traders said.\n  \n\n"}

He was\n  referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group\n  of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the\n  pact.\n      Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both\n  have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic\n  growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.\n  Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.\n      However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre\n  agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate\n  move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.\n      \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that\n  he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets\n  are off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency\n  analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.\n      But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine\n  view, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently\n  reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker\n  comment will regret it later on.\"\n      French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the\n  Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to\n  respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful\n  and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the\n  Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"\n      Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British\n  Treasury commented on the row.\n      But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite\n  U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does\n  not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the\n  Louvre Accord.\"\n      In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive\n  of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that\n  following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.\n  Was still committed to the accord.\n      In a move which the market interpreted as a possible\n  gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term\n  liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on\n  Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected\n  medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also\n  stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,\n  injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose\n  close to eight pct.\n  \n\n"}

Its gas\n  will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from\n  Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.\n      Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55\n  pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S>\n  (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> (nine pct) and &lt;Svenska\n  Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).\n  \n\n"}
